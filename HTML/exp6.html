<P>ATTACK ON TITAN is a Japanese dark fantasy anime television series, adapted from the manga series of the same name by Hajime Isayama. 
     The series premiered on April 7, 2013, and concluded on November 5, 2023. In the first season, the protagonist, Eren Yeager, witnesses his mother dying after being eaten by man-eating giant humanoid creatures called Titans.
      This becomes Eren's motivation to develop his combat skills in order to fight the Titans. Later on, Eren is eaten by a Titan himself but discovers that he can transform into a Titan, control it, and fight as he would as a human. 
     Eren learns how to use his newfound powers to combat the Titans and continues his training as more Titans continue to flood into his homeland.</P>
